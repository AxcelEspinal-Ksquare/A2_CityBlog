            <h3>History</h3>
            <p>This city was first populated by the Taínos, a native group of people with rudimentary lifestyles. After the Colonization (1492), when Columbus arrived to this isle, spanish people came in with african slaves and forced us to change our culture.</p>
            <p>Santo Domingo served as some sort of headquarters for Spain regarding the colonization of all of Latin America.</p>

            <p>
                Althought not born in Santo Domingo, the Mofongo has widely popularized between the citizens of this city, thanks to chains like <i><a href="https://www.instagram.com/mofongoelmocano/" target="_blank">Mofongo El Mocano</a></i> and <i><a href="https://www.instagram.com/laesquinadelchicharron/" target="_blank">La Esquina del Chicharrón.</a></i>
            </p>
            <p>
                Mofongo is pretty simple to make. Originally, it consists of barely fried mashed green plantains, with a lot of garlic and pieces of chicharrón (fried pork belly). Some other variations have come around, like adding cheese or mushroom sauce.
