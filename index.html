            <h3>History</h3>
            <p>
                Prior to the arrival of Christopher Columbus in 1492, the native Taíno people populated the island which they called Quisqueya, Kiskella (mother of all lands) and Ayiti (the land of the high mountains), and which Columbus later named Hispaniola, including the territory of today's Republic of Haiti. At the time, the island's territory consisted of five chiefdoms: Marién, Maguá, Maguana, Jaragua, and Higüey. These were ruled respectively by caciques (chiefs) Guacanagarix, Guarionex, Caonabo, Bohechío, and Cayacoa.
            </p>
            <p>
                Dating from 1493, when the Spanish settled on the island, and officially from 5 August 1498, Santo Domingo became the oldest European city in the Americas. Bartholomew Columbus founded the settlement and named it La Nueva Isabela, after an earlier settlement in the north named after the Queen of Spain Isabella I. In 1495 it was renamed "Santo Domingo", in honor of Saint Dominic. Santo Domingo came to be known as the "Gateway to the Caribbean" and the chief town in Hispaniola from then on. Expeditions which led to Ponce de León's colonization of Puerto Rico, Diego Velázquez de Cuéllar's colonization of Cuba, Hernando Cortes' conquest of Mexico, and Vasco Núñez de Balboa's sighting of the Pacific Ocean were all launched from Santo Domingo.

            <p>
                In June 1502, Santo Domingo was destroyed by a major hurricane, and the new Governor Nicolás de Ovando had it rebuilt on a different site on the other side of the Ozama River. The original layout of the city and a large portion of its defensive wall can still be appreciated today throughout the Colonial Zone, declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO.

            <p>
                Althought not born in Santo Domingo, the Mofongo has widely popularized between the citizens of this city, thanks to chains like <i><a href="https://www.instagram.com/mofongoelmocano/" target="_blank">Mofongo El Mocano</a></i> and <i><a href="https://www.instagram.com/laesquinadelchicharron/" target="_blank">La Esquina del Chicharrón.</a></i>
            </p>
            <p>
                Mofongo is pretty simple to make. Originally, it consists of barely fried mashed green plantains, with a lot of garlic and pieces of chicharrón (fried pork belly). Some other variations have come around, like adding cheese or mushroom sauce.
